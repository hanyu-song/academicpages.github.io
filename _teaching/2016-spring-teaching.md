[STA 210](http://stat.duke.edu/courses/STA210) is an undergraduate regression analysis course. The course covered the basics of linear regressions, including multiple regression, weighted least squares, logistic regression, log-linear models, analysis of variance, and model diagnostics. I was responsible teaching labs, grading homework, and answering student questions. I also wrote some of the lab materials, with the goal of helping students improve their programming and data analysis skills.
