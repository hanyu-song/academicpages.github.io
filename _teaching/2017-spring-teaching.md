[STA 663](http://stat.duke.edu/courses/STA663L) is a graduate-level programming course emphasizing the tools and methods necessary for statistical research. The course, taught by Dr [Cliburn Chan](https://genome.duke.edu/directory/cbb-faculty/cliburn-chan-phd), used [Python](https://www.python.org/) to teach optimization and simulation techniques relevant for statistics. I was nominated for the **best TA award** among masters students for my work on this course.
