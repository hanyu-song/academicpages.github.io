[STA 663](http://stat.duke.edu/courses/STA663L) is a graduate-level programming course emphasizing the tools and methods necessary for statistical research. The course, taught by Dr [Cliburn Chan](https://genome.duke.edu/directory/cbb-faculty/cliburn-chan-phd), used [Python](https://www.python.org/) to teach optimization and simulation techniques relevant for statistics. Using Python with Jupyter notebooks, the course covered Python programming, optimizaiton using Cython, just-in-time compilation, parallel programming, and integration of C++ with Python. It also covered relevant topics in linear algebra and optimization, such as matrix decompositions, vector spaces, stochastic gradient descent, and conjugate gradient descent.
