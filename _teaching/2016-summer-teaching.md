[STA 101](https://www2.stat.duke.edu/courses/Summer16/sta101.001-2/syllabus/) is an intensive introductory statistics course during the summer term. My work included leading twice-weekly lab section, answering student questions, holding office hours, and grading assignments and exams. As the course involved programming in [R](https://www.r-project.org), I was responsible for teaching students with no prior experience to use tools like [dplyr](http://dplyr.tidyverse.org) and [ggplot](http://ggplot2.org) to perform statistical analysis.
