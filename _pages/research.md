##Research Interests
As we have entered the era of big data, I feel that statistics needs to find ways to adequetly handle the massive data sets that are now common. This problem is especially pronounced for Bayesian statistics. Bayesian statistics has many advantages, such as automatic uncertainty quantification, the ability to incorporate prior knowledge in models, and the ability share information across experiments. These advantages, however, are of limited use in the face of big data because Bayesian computational methods scale very poorly. Thus there is a pressing need to develop methods for scalable Bayesian inference.
