## Hanyu Song
My name is Hanyu Song and I am a PhD candidate in [statistics](https://www.stat.duke.edu) at [Duke University](https://www.duke.edu/). I am interested in scalable inference, especially Bayesian inference using MCMC. I am currently working with [David Dunson](http://stat.duke.edu/people/david-b-dunson).
